# Things Learned
1. Rows in the first half of the board are connected, rows in the second half are connected,
   but rows in first half are not connected to the second.
2. Rows get their data from output of 3-8 demux (74HC237), the three inputs of demux are connected to input connector
3. Columns get their data from the latches (74HC373), inputs of which are connected to input connector.
4. Row scanning occurs, the darlington array (ULN2003) inverts its inputs, result being that one line will be LOW, the rest HIGH
   at any point.
5. There are 2 ULN2003A. Output of 1 ULN2003A connected to the rows in the first half,
   the other ULN2003A connected to rows in second half.
6. Corresponding inputs of both ULN2003A are connected.
