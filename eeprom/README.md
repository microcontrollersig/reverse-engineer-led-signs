# Adventures with 8031

#### Files

This file was the one recovered from EEPROM using programmer
https://github.com/microcontrollersig/reverse-engineer-led-signs/raw/master/eeprom/eepromseansign.bin

This file is the disassembly using mcu8051ide
https://github.com/microcontrollersig/reverse-engineer-led-signs/blob/master/eeprom/eepromseansign.asm

This is also a disassembly, but with actual locations in EEPROM and opcodes
https://github.com/microcontrollersig/reverse-engineer-led-signs/blob/master/eeprom/eepromseansignlst.asm

This file is the intel hex equivalent needed for emu8051
https://github.com/microcontrollersig/reverse-engineer-led-signs/raw/master/eeprom/eepromseansign.hex

#### Tools
A fool with a tool is still a fool!

Used the following using Ubuntu:

* emu8051
* mcu8051ide

On Windows:

* HxD best hex editor
* Windows 10 calculator in Programmer mode great for conversion between dec/hex/binary 

mcu8051ide is hardcore, emu8051 is lean and nifty.
